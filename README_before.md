# CASA0019 - Noise Level Monitor 
## DATASET  
The device collects real-time noise level data from a sound level meter and transmits it to a digital dashboard for further analysis.

## DATA DEVICE (Physical)  
The Physical device is divided into two parts. The first part is a Christmas tree wrapped by LED strips, and the pixel on the LED strips will display different colors according to the decibel value of noise. The second part is the LCD TFT display, which can display the Time Domain graph of the real-time noise.

## DATA DEVICE (Digital)  
The digital twin of the device will provide extra information, and it will provide a dashboard with five parts: The ring chart can display the accurate decibel value, the Frequency Spectrum shows the real-time frequency of Noise, and the Noise Exposure can be synchronized with the physcial device in color display. The Sound Signal exhibits real-time changes in amplitude. Decial volume shows changes in noise with length and color.

## HOW TO 
Open the app and scan the QR code on the physical device. The dashboard will appear directly above the QR code, and can observe the changes of each data through three-finger zooming.
